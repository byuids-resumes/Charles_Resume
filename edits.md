Notes:

You did a great job on your resume! I liked the reference part. I think you could add you linkedin account if you do have one. 
I also really liked that you put down your eagle scout! I need to add that to mine! 

Hopefully as you go through college you will be able to add to the projects and experience. 
This resume looks pretty good to me!
